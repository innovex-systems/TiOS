# The inelligent Operating System : TiOS

__TiOS__ (Pronounced _Ty OS_ or more like _Thai OS_ but trust me, it's not from Thailand) is an open source operating system based on _[Debian GNU/Linux](https://debian.org)_ and made for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and also personal computers.

## The Goal

The whole goal of TiOS is to gather all the AI tools designed by [M Corp](m-corp.ir) like _Mann-E_ or _Maral_ in one place for the day-to-day user. These AI products will help people to improve their lives and works and also there might be a chance for future of having AI powered _local apps_ for everyone in this operating system.
